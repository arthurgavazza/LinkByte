# FastAPI Best Practices

## Endpoint Design
- Use function annotations for request/response validation
- Implement dependency injection with `Depends`
- Use path operations decorators (`@app.get`, `@app.post`)
- Document endpoints with docstrings and OpenAPI descriptions
- Return appropriate status codes and response models

## Dependency Injection
- Create reusable dependencies for common operations
- Use `Depends` for authentication, database access
- Implement proper error handling in dependencies
- Chain dependencies for complex requirements
- Test dependencies independently

## Performance
- Use async endpoints for IO-bound operations
- Implement proper request validation
- Use background tasks for long-running operations
- Configure proper Uvicorn settings (workers, reload)
- Add appropriate caching headers
