Say "Rule test-automation loaded!" if this rule is being applied.

# Test Automation

## Test Coverage Strategy
- Write tests for critical business logic
- Cover happy paths and edge cases
- Test error handling and validation
- Focus on user-facing functionality
- Isolate tests from external dependencies

## Frontend Test Strategy
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Focus on user interaction over implementation
- Test state changes and UI updates
- Use Storybook component tests for visual components
- Use Jest for utility functions and hooks

## Backend Test Strategy
- Use pytest fixtures for database and dependencies
- Create test factories for test data
- Test API endpoints with client fixtures
- Isolate database tests with transaction rollbacks
- Mock external services and API calls

## Command Patterns
- Run `pytest` after every significant backend change
- Execute `npm run test` after frontend component updates
- Generate coverage reports weekly to monitor improvements
- Include test commands in pull request comments
- Always verify a failing test is fixed with `pytest path/to/test`

## Test Execution Guidelines
- Run tests before committing any code
- Fix all failing tests before marking work as complete
- Add new tests when implementing new features
- Update existing tests when modifying functionality
- Never ignore test failures
