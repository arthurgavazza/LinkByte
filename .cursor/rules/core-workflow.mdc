# Development Workflow

## Feature Implementation
- Define clear requirements before starting
- Create structure/skeleton before details
- Implement tests alongside functionality
- Run quality checks before submission
- Add proper documentation

## Cursor AI Patterns
- Provide context about existing architecture
- Specify desired patterns and constraints
- Include file references for consistency
- Ask for test implementation with features
- Break complex tasks into smaller chunks

```
Create a React component for [purpose] that:
- Accepts these props: [list]
- Manages these states: [list]
- Follows project patterns from [file]
- Includes tests for [scenarios]
```

## Code Review
- Verify requirements implementation
- Check test coverage and quality
- Ensure consistent code style
- Look for security issues
- Validate error handling
